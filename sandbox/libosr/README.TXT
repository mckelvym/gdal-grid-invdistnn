LibOSR Overview
===============

LibOSR is a subset of the GDAL/OGR source tree with just enough files
to provide the OGRSpatialReference class. Useful for applications that
require SRS conversion support without carrying a complete copy of the
GDAL library.

Since this is just a subset of the GDAL/OGR source tree, it is available 
under the same open source license. See http://www.gdal.org/

Source repository
